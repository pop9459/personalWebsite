  <p>This project is a 3D Tower Defense game developed in Unity as a "maturita" exam project. The game was created with a focus on functionality, playability, visual appeal, and future extensibility. Key technologies and tools used include Unity ProBuilder for 3D modeling and level design, and C# programming with Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 for game logic and scripting. The game involves strategic placement of towers to defend against waves of enemies.</p>
