    <h3>Development goal 1:</h3>
    <p>
        For the first goal I wanted to add something to my technical skills.
        Since our main project was revolving around a mobile app I decided this is a good opportunity to learn Flutter.
        I chose Flutter because it has been on my radar for a while and I wanted to learn it.
        Despite the app not being absolutely perfect, I still learned a lot about Flutter and Dart.
        I am certain this is a valuable expansion of my skill-set.

    <h3>Development goal 2:</h3>
    <p>
        For this goal I wanted to improve my dutch language vocabulary.
        To do this I used the Duolingo app and set a goal to to 1 lesson per day for the whole period
        I had one day off during the start but after that I managed to keep up with the goal.

    <h3>Development goal 3:</h3>
    <p>
        For this goal I wanted to improve my physical shape.
        Unfortunately I did not have much luck with this one.
        I started out strong, but then I got sick and after that I just had too much work back log.
        Despite this I am keeping this in mind and want to try again in the future.
