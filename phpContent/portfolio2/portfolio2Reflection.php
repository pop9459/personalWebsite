        This is a reflection report on my first year of studying at IT at the university of NHL Stenden in Emmen.
        It is mostly tailored to include all te requirements from the checklist provided by my lecturer. 
        It touches on topics like consequences of my actions, teamwork experiences or my personal study experiences.
        It also contains an evaluation of the results of my PDP plan. 
        One of the PDP goals is reflected on using the STARRT method.
